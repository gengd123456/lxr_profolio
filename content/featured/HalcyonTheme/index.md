Roomi is a shared-living task management system built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL, supporting user authentication, task assignment, progress tracking, and photo-based submissions. The app uses REST APIs and Multer-powered uploads to manage profiles, task records, and rating data, while the front end is implemented with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to deliver a mobile-style interactive UI for household collaboration.
