Storica is an interactive web experience designed to guide users through Venice’s historical landmarks with an accessible, mobile-first interface. The project features semantic HTML and modular CSS styling, combined with JavaScript-driven functionality including a sliding navigation menu, swipeable fact-card carousel, scroll-aware navigation bar, audio-guided storytelling, and modal-based image zoom. Each building page integrates structured narratives, responsive layouts, and keyboard-friendly controls, creating an engaging digital tour that blends cultural content with modern front-end interaction patterns.
