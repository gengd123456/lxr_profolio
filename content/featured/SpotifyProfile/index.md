MOONIE is an educational finance platform offering daily insights, structured lessons, quizzes, and lightweight AI-assisted predictions.

The project features a fully implemented front-end built with HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, including dynamic content rendering, SVG-based data visualisation, interactive pop-ups, countdown timers, and reusable UI components. The system emphasises scalable architecture, consistent styling, and smooth user interaction across all app flows.
